Unavoidable Date Website

This is a playful and light-hearted website that asks the user a fun question:  
"Would you like to go out with me? Are you free tomorrow?"

The website presents two options, "Yes" and "No," but you can not select "No" option whenever you try click it moves , meaning the user can only select "Yes"â€”creating a humorous twist!

Features

- Two HTML Pages: 
  - index.html: The main page with the invitation question and response options.
  - yes.html: A playful confirmation page after the user selects "Yes."
  
- Two CSS Pages:
  - style.css: Styles for the main page.
  - yes_style.css: Styles for the confirmation page.

- Images Folder: 
  - Contains images used throughout the website for a more visually appealing experience.
